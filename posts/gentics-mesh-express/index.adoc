title: Getting started with Express and the API-first CMS Gentics Mesh
banner: express-lane.jpg
teaser: Fast, unopinionated, minimalist. Express is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks out there. It simplifies routing and handling data. This blogpost is part of a series in which we show you how to combine the API-first CMS Gentics Mesh with popular frameworks, such as Express. Our focus is especially on routing and displaying the content with templates..

Gentics Mesh is the CMS backend for your web applications and apps. It's API-first so you can choose your favorite languages and frameworks. In this blogpost we are going to provide you with an example for getting started with Gentics Mesh and link:http://expressjs.com/[Express] together with the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise-any[request-promise library] as well as the link:https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/[Nunjucks template engine]. See how easy it is to swap out technologies and check out the exact same link:http://getmesh.io/Blog/Building+an+API-first+Web+App+with+Gentics+Mesh+and+the+PHP+Microframework+Silex[example using the PHP micro-framework Silex together with the Twig template engine].

== Getting Ready

Clone the example from the Gentics Mesh Repository on link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-express-example[Github]

```
git clone https://github.com/gentics/mesh-express-example.git
cd mesh-express-example
```

Update the node dependencies

```
npm install
```

Download Gentics Mesh & start server

* link:http://getmesh.io/Download[Download Gentics Mesh]

```
# 1. Start Gentics Mesh 
java -jar mesh-demo-0.24.xx.jar

# 2. Start the express server
node index.js
```

== The Example

Once set up you should be able to access the running Express server via http://localhost:3000.

The example consists of a small website which lists various vehicles from our demo data. The vehicles are grouped into categories which can be browsed individually. The example also features a breadcrumb navigation and image handling via Gentics Mesh.

== Walkthrough

The main logic of our example is located within the link:https://github.com/gentics/mesh-express-example/blob/master/index.js[index.js] file.

The express route handler accepts these requests and processes them. We use the `request-promise` link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/request-promise-any[library] to chain the outbound requests.

The link:https://getmesh.io/docs/beta/#_webroot[Gentics Mesh webroot API] makes it very easy to find contents for a corresponding web path. All request paths are passed along to this API in order to load the corresponding node which contains data needed to render the page.

A node can either be a node of type 'category', 'vehicle' or 'vehicleImage'. The schema type information of a node is used to switch between different pages. Loading a category node, for example, will result in the product list template to be rendered. A product node on the other hand will result in a product detail page.

In this example we use the link:https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/[Nunjucks template engine] to render the templates.

The templates are structured and utilize link:https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#extends[template inheritance] which is a great way to reuse common parts.

The `base.njk` template contains the needed includes and definitions for the link:http://getbootstrap.com/[Twitter Bootstrap] template.


By default a breadcrumb navigation is added to each page. We moved the code for the navigation into the `navigation.njk` file. The Gentics Mesh link:http://getmesh.io/docs/beta/#_navigations[Navigation Root API] is used to load the needed breadcrumb information for the root level.

Hint: In our example only a single level is used and as such the navigation is not changing. In more complex examples the Navigation Root API can also be used to build up multi-level menus which can also be affected by user permissions.

The `welcome.njk` template just displays some information about the example for requests to the index page. (e.g.http://localhost/).

The `productList.njk` template is used to display categories. A category can contain multiple products. The template uses a simple loop which iterates over all products in order to display each one. The `/api/v1/demo/nodes/:categoryUuid/children` endpoint of Gentics Mesh is used here to load all products for a certain category.

Hint: All endpoints which return lists of items can be easily paged. If you plan to display many more items it would be good to also render a paging element.

The `productDetail.njk` template is used to display all product information on a single page. In this case it is sufficient to pass the resolved Node directly to the template. The needed files can thus be directly used. e.g.: `{{ product.fields.description }}`.

We hope this example was informative and showed you how easy it is to utilize Express in combination with Gentics Mesh to build a small template-based website.
