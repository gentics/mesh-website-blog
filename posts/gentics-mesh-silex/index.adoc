title: Building an API-first Web App with Gentics Mesh and the PHP Microframework Silex
author: Johannes Sch√ºth
created: Jan 19, 2017
teaser: Silex is a PHP microframework based on Symfony used to develop small web applications. In this example we use Silex and its basic routing engine with the Twig template engine to read and display the data we read from our API-First CMS Gentics Mesh. And since Mesh provides API Endpoints and manages all the data for us, we can focus on the frontend part. But it also provides us with the opportunity to swap out Silex for a more complex Framework anytime.

In this blogpost we would like to show you how easy it is to use Gentics Mesh in combination with link:http://silex.sensiolabs.org/[Silex], a microframework for PHP.

== Getting Ready

All needed dependencies were added to the composer.json. You can use the link:https://getcomposer.org/[PHP Composer] to download these.

The following steps are needed to set up the example:

== The Example

Once set up you should be able to access the running Apache instance via `http://localhost`.

The example consists of a small website which lists various vehicles from our demo data. The vehicles are grouped into categories which can be browsed individually. The example also features a small breadcrumb and image handling via Gentics Mesh.

== Walkthrough

The main logic of our example is located within the `index.php` file. Note: The example contains some PHP 7 features. You can also use older PHP versions if you remove the type information from the functions.

All Apache requests will be redirected to the `index.php` file using the `.htaccess` rules. The Silex route handler accepts these requests and processes them.

The link:http://getmesh.io/docs/beta/#_webroot[Gentics Mesh webroot API] makes it very easy to find contents for a corresponding web path. As such all request paths are passed along to this API in order to load the corresponding node.

In our example, a node can either be a node of type 'category', 'vehicle' or 'vehicleImage'. The schema type information of a node is used to switch between different pages. Loading a category node for example will result in the product list template to be rendered. A product node on the other hand will result in a product detail page.

We use the link:http://silex.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.0/providers/twig.html[Twig template engine] to render the templates. This template format is directly supported by Silex and very easy to set up.

In our example we make use of link:http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/2.x/tags/extends.html[template inheritance] which is a great way to structure the templates and reuse common parts.

The `base.twig` template contains the needed includes and definitions for the link:http://getbootstrap.com/[Twitter Bootstrap] template.

By default a breadcrumb navigation is added to each page. We moved the code for the navigation into the `navigation.twig` file. The Gentics Mesh Navigation Root API is used to load the needed breadcrumb information for the root level.

Hint: In our example only a single level is used and as such the navigation is not changing. In more complex examples the link:http://getmesh.io/docs/beta/#_navigations[Navigation Root API] can also be used to build up multi-level menus which can also be affected by user permissions.

The `welcome.twig` template just displays some information about the example for requests to the index page. (e.g. `http://localhost/`).

The `productList.twig` template is used to display categories. A category can contain multiple products. The template contains a simple loop which iterates over all products in order to display each one. The `/api/v1/demo/nodes/:categoryUuid/children` endpoint of Gentics Mesh is used here to load all products for a certain category.


Hint: All endpoints which return lists of items can be easily paged. If you plan to display much more items it would be good to also render a paging element.

The `productDetail.twig` template is finally used to display all product information on a single page. In this case it is sufficient to pass the resolved Node directly to the template. The needed files can thus be directly used. e.g.: `{{ product.fields.description }}`.

Finally the whole project can also be packaged into a single docker container using the provided `Dockerfile`. The apache rewrite module must be enabled in order to support the `.htaccess` redirection rules.

We hope this example was informative and showed you how easy it is to utilize Silex in combination with Gentics Mesh to build a small template based website.

Feel free to drop a comment if you have and questions or feedback about the shown implementation.
