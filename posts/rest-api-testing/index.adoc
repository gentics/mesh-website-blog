In this post I would like to share some insight and ideas on REST API testing.

There are different aproaches on how to actually test APIs.

One way to test your API is to first specify the design and later use a tool to generate the tests.

http://rest-assured.io/

For Gentics Mesh we decided to write our own REST Client and also use this client for all of our tests.
This way tests can be build independenly and don't relay on the contract being generated.
Overall this resulted in a flexible workflow which allowed for fast `test->change->test` development cycles.

When writing tests you are often faced with the question what should be tested.

Lets assume you have a very basic API such as:

```
GET /api/v1/users/
GET /api/v1/users/:uuid
DELETE /api/v1/users/:uuid
POST /api/v1/users
```

== Concurrent creation

Concurrency test are important to discover multi threading issues.

== Conflict handling

When creating a resource with a unique name it is worth testing that a conflict error `409` is returned when a name is used which already belongs to another resource. 

== Payload validation

The JSON payload of the response should be validated on the server-side. 
Validation failures 

== Test for missing resources

== Test for bogus uuid's

Loading a wrong non existing resource should result in a `404` error.


== Test for idempotency 

Idempotency is important in building a fault-tolerant API. Invoking multiple delete requests for example should not lead to unexpected results. It should be safe to invoke `DELETE`, `PUT`, `HEAD`, `GET`, `OPTIONS` on the same resource.

== Events

Some systems may also handle events. A event could be dispatched after user creation for example.
